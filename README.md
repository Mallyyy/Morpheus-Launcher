# Morpheus-Launcher

This launcher specifies whatever java your client is using. Jar this using artifact, and be sure the jar is packed with the same java version your client uses or this launcher will not work proper for you. 

Secondly, this launcher is fully gif compatable. You can upload up to 30 second gifs with 0 problems. 

Thirdly if you want the obfuscation for this launcher, please contact me Mallyy. It isnt hard to find me. 

The launcher also has news sections that can be replaced by simply creating a link to a png like you would for your client. You can update the png live without having to have others redownload a launcher.
